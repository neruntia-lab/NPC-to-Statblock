This Foundry VTT module adds a button to NPC actor sheets which exports the sheet as a statblock styled PDF.

## Features

- Compiles the actor's data, abilities and items into a PDF using **jsPDF**.
- Portrait can be aligned left or right and text wraps around it.
- Traits, actions, bonus actions, reactions and legendary actions are separated into their own sections.
- Colors and fonts are configurable in the module settings.
- Saving throws, senses, languages and movement speeds are pulled from the actor data.
